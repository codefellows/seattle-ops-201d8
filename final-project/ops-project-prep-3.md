# Repo and Presentation Slides

Today we will create your project repo and setup your tooling for project management.

## Deliverable

Each group will create a GitHub “Organization”, add team members as members of the organization, and create the repositories there. Don't forget to customize everyone's permissions so that all team members are an "Admin".

The name of the org and the repo should be **resume-ready**. Use the the problem domain or another professional-sounding team name. Don't call it `201Final` or `project-week` or `reeses-puffs` or similar.

> This project may well be a key piece of your resume. Potential employers will be looking at this project and it’s documentation. Name it accordingly.

## Build your repos and README files:

Create all the repos and `README.md` files you will need for your project.

By the end of you project, your organization and repos should include the following:

1. Create a basic `README.md` file for your organization that contains the names of all the members as well as a description of the project.
  - The `README.md` file should be attractively formatted and include:
    - Links to each of your GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
    - Links to all other repos containing project material.
1. Create a repo for Presentation and Project Organization materials:
  - Include a PDF of your slideshow as files in the repo.
  - In the `README.md` file, include:
    - Links to the Team Agreement doc and System Selection doc.
    - Link to the PM tool your team is using to manage tasks.
    - Links and explanations for any files in the repo (such as the PDF of your slideshow).
    - A link to the video of your presentation (when it becomes available).
1. Create a repo for any documentation (such as SOPs, network topologies, etc.):
  - Include all required documentation as files in the repo.
    - Written documentation can either be:
      - Worked on as Google Docs and committed to the repo as PDFs.
      - Worked on and committed as Markdown files.
    - See the Project Requirements for details on what documentation your instructor is expecting.
    - System topologies and other visuals should be include as either image files or PDFs.
      - In the case of topologies, include the raw topology files (for instance, if using Draw.io, include the `.drawio` files).
    - Include any relevant information required for the operation of the demonstrated system.
  - On the `README.md` file, label and link all written and visual documentation.
1. Create a repo for any scripts you create in the course of your project.
  - Include any scripts specified in the Project Requirements document, and any other scripts and tools you create along the way. 
  - All scripts should:
    - Be properly formatted.
    - Include header documentation including authorship, script name, purpose, and date.
    - Have the appropriate file extension in the file name.
  - Create a basic `README.md` file within the repo that contains links to each script. For each script, also include:
    - The names of all the members who contributed to the script.
    - A description of the script including the WHAT and WHY.
    - Any resources or references used in creating the script here as well.


## Project Management Tools

Make sure everyone has access and correct permissions to the tool you are using.

Please use one of these tools listed below:

1. [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira){:target="_blank"}
1. [Trello](https://trello.com/){:target="_blank"}
1. [GitHub Projects](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards){:target="_blank"}

Build out sections to help organize tasks. Try using labels such as “To Do”, “In Progress”, “Done” and “Stretch Goals”. Organize your PM Tool however you think is best for your team!

Grant the instructor access to your project management tool for review during daily stand-ups.

## Presentation Deck

Make a single copy of the [Presentation Deck Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iv8uB6H0P49RN9IF6cYA5lpfiuL4WBGQqcbEu6Q4JAA/edit#slide=id.g8526846ab1_1_5){:target="_blank"}. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same slideshow.

Link the shared doc in your PM tool.

The presentation should follow exactly from the [template slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iv8uB6H0P49RN9IF6cYA5lpfiuL4WBGQqcbEu6Q4JAA/edit#slide=id.g8526846ab1_1_5){:target="_blank"}. Ensure your timing is no more than 15 minutes long, including some time at the end for questions.

Each member should introduce themselves with their personal pitch.

Each member of the team must have at least one demo and one speaking part. It is okay to use notes if you are nervous about forgetting what to talk about. Some of the areas to discuss include:
  - An introduction of the client company and their requests and needs.
  - A demonstration of the solutions with an explanation of the WHAT and WHY behind it.
  - A technical obstacle or two and how those obstacles were overcome.
  - A portion of the final solution that each team member is particularly proud of.

See the Project Guidelines for list of required components.
