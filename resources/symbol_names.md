## A Warning About Smart Quotes vs. Straight Quotes

`“`Double Smart Quotes`”` and `‘`Single Smart Quotes`’` are different from `"`Double Straight Quotes`"` and `'`Single Straight Quotes`'` (also known as Dumb Quotes).

Smart Quotes are common in "normal" text on the internet or in web browsers, and can sometimes end up in your code when you copy and paste text.

**WARNING: Smart Quotes will cause your code to fail!!!**
```
“...”  !=  "..."
‘...’  !=  '...'
```
